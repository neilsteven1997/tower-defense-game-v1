"Generate a complete, simple web-based tower defense game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Ensure no server-side languages like PHP are used; all logic must be front-end.

Core Features:

    Game Area: A visually clear game board (e.g., a grid or canvas).
    Enemy Path: A pre-defined, visible path (e.g., from left to right, or a winding path) that enemies will follow.
    Enemy Spawning: Implement basic enemies (e.g., 'Goblin' type) that appear at the start of the path and move towards the end. Enemies should have simple visuals and a health value.
    Tower Placement: Allow the player to place one type of 'Basic Turret' on designated, non-path grid cells. Provide a starting currency (e.g., 'Gold: 100') to buy towers.
    Tower Functionality: Towers should automatically detect and fire at the closest enemy within their circular range. Display a simple projectile or hit animation.
    Damage & Destruction: Enemies lose health when hit. When an enemy's health reaches zero, it is removed, and the player gains a small amount of gold.
    Game Over Condition: If a set number of enemies reach the end of the path (e.g., 5 enemies), display a 'Game Over' message.

UI Elements:

    Display for current Gold.
    Simple 'Start Wave' button to release a new batch of enemies.

Constraints:

    Focus on core functionality. No complex pathfinding, multiple tower upgrades, or enemy types beyond basic variations initially.
    Keep visual assets simple (e.g., colored squares/circles for enemies/towers if custom images are too complex for the AI).
    All game state and logic handled purely in JavaScript."
